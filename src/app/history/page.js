            <h1 className={styles['title']}>The History of Tarot</h1>
            <p>
                Tarot cards have a rich and fascinating history that spans several centuries. While the exact origins of
                Tarot are somewhat obscure, it is believed to have emerged in Europe during the Renaissance era.

            <h2 className={styles['title']}>The Early Days of Tarot</h2>
            <p>
                The oldest known Tarot decks date back to the mid-15th century in Italy. These early decks were not used
                for divination but instead were used for playing card games, similar to modern-day bridge or poker. The
                decks were often commissioned by wealthy families and featured ornate, hand-painted designs.

            <h2 className={styles['title']}>The Visconti-Sforza Tarot</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most famous early Tarot decks is the Visconti-Sforza Tarot, created in Milan during the 15th
                century. This deck was commissioned by the Visconti and Sforza families, two of the most powerful
                Italian dynasties of the time. The Visconti-Sforza Tarot is known for its beautiful, detailed imagery
                and is considered a masterpiece of Renaissance art.

            <h2 className={styles['title']}>Tarot and Occultism</h2>
            <p>
                In the late 18th century, Tarot began to be associated with occultism and mysticism. This shift was
                largely due to the work of Antoine Court de GÃ©belin, a French occultist who claimed that Tarot cards
                contained secret wisdom from ancient Egypt. While this theory has been largely discredited, it helped to
                popularize the use of Tarot for divination and spiritual growth.
            </p>
            <h2 className={styles['title']}>The Rider-Waite-Smith Tarot</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most influential Tarot decks in history is the Rider-Waite-Smith Tarot, created in 1909 by
                Arthur Edward Waite and illustrated by Pamela Colman Smith. This deck was revolutionary in its design,
                featuring detailed, symbolic imagery on every card, including the Minor Arcana. The Rider-Waite-Smith
                Tarot remains one of the most popular and widely used decks today.
            </p>
            <h2 className={styles['title']}>Modern Tarot</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Tarot has continued to evolve and grow in popularity. Today,
                there are countless Tarot decks available, each with its own unique artwork and symbolism. Tarot is used
                by people all over the world for personal growth, self-discovery, and spiritual guidance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite its mysterious origins and the many myths and misconceptions surrounding it, Tarot remains a
                powerful tool for those seeking to connect with their intuition and gain a deeper understanding of
                themselves and the world around them.
